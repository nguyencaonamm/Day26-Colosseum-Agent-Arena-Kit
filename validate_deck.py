"""validate_deck.py — the offline legality gate (CONTRACTS.md section 8, RULES.md section 5).

    python validate_deck.py [deck.json] [lineup.json] [--world PATH]

(`Makefile:29`'s `make validate` calls it positionally: `validate_deck.py deck/deck.json
deck/lineup.json` — both arguments are optional here and default to exactly that, so a bare
`python validate_deck.py` from the repo root also works.)

RULES.md section 5, verbatim, is the checklist this module exists to enforce **before** a card
ever reaches the tournament ("Invalid cards never enter the tournament — they are rejected at
lock, not at play"):

    14 cards: 10 attacks + 4 blanks. You play 10 in a locked order, no repeats.
    >=3 MCP-layer . >=3 A2A-layer . >=2 gateway-layer . >=6 distinct classes of the nine
    every `replica_flip` card must name a `path_id` in the measured drift set
    lethality band: it must fall to `rookie` and be held by `adversary`

Every failure this module reports names the card, the rule, and what to change — "failures must
be specific and fixable" (this task's own brief) — never a bare "invalid deck".

WHAT THIS MODULE CAN AND CANNOT CHECK, HONESTLY
================================================================================================
This file lives in the STUDENT KIT, which RULES.md section 2 restricts to **standard library
only, plus `kit/`** — it may never import `Day26-Colosseum-Agent-Arena.*` (the mutation engine, the
referee, the real bot ladder all live there, and a real student never has that repo). Two
consequences, both handled by degrading LOUDLY rather than silently:

1. **The world.** `kit/world/` ships empty until an `export_kit_world.py` Makefile target exists
   to populate it (a real, separately-tracked gap — WORLDBUILD-REPORT.md's own P0 finding, not
   fixed here). :func:`resolve_world` tries `kit/world/` first, and falls back to
   `kit.world.fixture.build_fixture_world` — the small, synthetic-but-real fixture world already
   shipped in the kit — printing which one it used. Anchor/drift-set checks against the fixture
   are real checks, just over a much smaller world than the actual 12,375-page corpus; run this
   tool with `--world <path-to-a-real-export>` once one exists for the guarantee that matters.

2. **The lethality band.** "Falls to rookie" and "held by adversary" name two bots
   (`bots/rookie/`, `bots/adversary/`) which ship in this kit but cannot be PLAYED from here
   the time this module was written), and the live mutation engine that would actually PLAY a
   card lives in the arena, not the kit. Rather than fabricate a fake bot or silently skip the
   rule RULES.md promises this tool checks, :func:`check_lethality_band` implements the two
   HONEST, KIT-ONLY, MECHANICAL proxies that do not need either:

   * **falls to rookie** — "rookie... trusts everything... no guardrails" (FINAL-PLAN.md section
     9) is, by that definition, a gateway that forwards every command. Whether a card's mutation
     "falls" against one is exactly the question "does this op find a real, resolvable target to
     poison in the world, given nothing stops it" — answerable here with the SAME kit-only
     primitives the live engine is built from (`kit.world.loader.World.page`,
     `kit.mcp.a2a.mint_delegation`/`verify_card`), reimplemented narrowly, once, for this one
     purpose, and documented as deliberately mirroring `arena/mutations.py`'s own preconditions
     for `applied=True` (a sibling module this task also built, not importable from here).
   * **held by adversary** — the real adversary bot's actual policy cannot be evaluated without
     it existing. What CAN be checked mechanically, using only this file's own referee-detector
     algebra (a two-line reimplementation of CONTRACTS section 6.4's `enforcement_failure` rule:
     `applied AND trigger_matched AND verdict != "deny" => violation`), is that the card is not
     *undefendable in principle* — that denying the specific command carrying the mutation's
     target structurally prevents the violation. This is NECESSARY for "a correct policy holds
     it" but not sufficient proof that `bots/adversary/`'s actual heuristic would find that
     denial; :func:`check_lethality_band` labels this sub-check `HELD_IN_PRINCIPLE`, distinct
     from a claim that the real bot was run, and the report says so in exactly those words.

   Both proxies are reported at their own named severity (`FAIL` only for the mechanical checks
   this module can actually stand behind; a separate `WARN`-level note for the bot-ladder gap) —
   never silently passed, never silently skipped.

Stdlib only, plus `kit/`. No network, no wall-clock, no randomness.
