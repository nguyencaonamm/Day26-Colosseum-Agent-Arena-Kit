"""agent/telemetry.py — thin wrappers around `GatewayContext.emit` (CONTRACTS.md 4.2).

READ THIS TWICE BEFORE YOU WRITE YOUR FIRST `self._telemetry.note(...)` CALL:

    EVERYTHING THIS FILE RECORDS GOES TO `own_telemetry` L1 EVENTS
    (CONTRACTS.md 5.2). `own_telemetry` IS:

      - NEVER SCORED.       No referee detector, no rubric class, no claim
                             gate anywhere in CONTRACTS.md section 6 reads
                             an `own_telemetry` event. Emitting one cannot
                             earn you credit, and — just as importantly —
                             a *missing* one cannot cost you any either.

      - NEVER SHOWN TO THE OPPONENT. CONTRACTS.md 5.4, verbatim: "The
        opponent's L1 events only, with `own_telemetry` removed." Your
        prosecutor never sees a single note you write here, and neither
        does the team across the table.

      - PRODUCER-STAMPED `student`, PERMANENTLY YOURS. CONTRACTS.md 5.1:
        "Only `arena` and `referee` may emit L1/L2. A `student`-produced L1
        event is an `integrity` violation" — `own_telemetry` is the one
        L1 event type a student producer is allowed to write at all, and
        it stays that way because nothing downstream ever treats it as an
        authoritative fact about what happened. The AUTHORITATIVE record
        of what your gateway did lives in the `command` / `decision` /
        `enforced` / `tool_call` / `tool_result` events the ARENA writes
        around your `Decision` (see agent/gateway.py's module docstring) —
        those are the ones a prosecutor reads and the ones that decide
        `enforcement_failure`. This file's events are never a substitute
        for that; they are commentary alongside it.

So why write any of this at all? Because "never scored, never shown" is
exactly what makes it safe to be HONEST in. What you record here is what
YOU can prove to YOURSELF, after the fact, about why your gateway did what
it did — which command looked suspicious and why you let it through anyway,
which round your budget got tight, which anchor you decided to trust
without re-verifying. None of that helps you in the moment it happens; all
of it helps you find your own bugs before a prosecutor finds them for you,
and it is the raw material for `eval/prosecute.py` development against
runs you own (FINAL-PLAN.md section 5.3) before you ever point a prosecutor
at someone else's trace.

Stdlib only. No network, no randomness, no wall-clock reads.
